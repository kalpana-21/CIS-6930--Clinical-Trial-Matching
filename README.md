# CIS-6930--Clinical-Trial-Matching

main.py file is the main file consisting of all the actual code

preprocess_data.py file consists of code to preprocess the data before input to the BERT model

Current Status:  
we have worked on preprocessing the data and creating embeddings for each record. We have trained the classifier to classify patients to clinical trials, which was the final step in producing results for our problem. The results are output as a file and attached in the same repo. Post results, we evaluated our models with metrics to check accuracy and f1 scores.
