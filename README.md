# CIS-6930--Clinical-Trial-Matching

main.py file is the main file consisting of all the actual code

preprocess_data.py file consists of code to preprocess the data before input to the BERT model

Current Status:  
we have worked on preprocessing the data and creating embeddings for each record. Currently, we are working on training the classifier to classify patients to clinical trials, which is the final step in producing results for our problem. Post this; we would test the model and perform a metric evaluation to analyze how well our model performs on unstructured data.
